===========================
Django Google Sheets Import
===========================

The ``django-gsheets-import`` Python package is a Django application to facilitate data import from Google Sheets within Django's admin framework.
It extends the great `django-import-export <https://github.com/django-import-export/django-import-export>`_ package, which already provides import and export capabilities for all local file formats supported by `tablib <https://github.com/jazzband/tablib>`_.
Exporting data from Django's admin to Google Sheets is currently not supported by ``django-gsheets-import``, but planned for a future release.
